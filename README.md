# Upstream Dashboard

Welcome to the Upstream Dashboard project! This is a fictitious project that simulates fetching and displaying emails from a fictitious API, built mainly using React and React Query. The project is designed to be used as a peer programming session.

## Getting Started

1. Install all the necessary dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

2. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to verify everything is working as expected.

4. Take a minute to familiarize yourself with the project structure.

Once you have verified that the project is running correctly and you are familiar with the project structure, you are ready to begin the peer programming session.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to mimic a simple email dashboard where emails fetched from a fake API are displayed in a tabular format. The main goal is to assess your general programming skills, the quality of your thought process, and your interactions and exchanges during the session, rather than your proficiency in React or React Query specifically.

Good luck, and enjoy your peer programming session!
